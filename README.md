# iOS Picker Generator for Sketch
### Mock iOS Picker in Sketch using [MagicMirror](http://magicsketch.io/mirror/) Plugin.

A Sketch template useful when you're in need to mock one of these iOS pickers. This gizmo is a particular pain to recreate so I made a template for it.

1. If you haven't already, Install [MagicMirror](http://magicsketch.io/mirror/).
2. Edit your picker options.
3. Unselect everything and refresh MagicMirror.
4. Grab your picker mockup.
