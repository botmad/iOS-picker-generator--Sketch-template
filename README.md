# iOS Picker Generator for Sketch
### [Mock iOS pickers ](https://botmad.github.io/Template.Sketch.ios-picker-generator/) in Sketch using [MagicMirror](http://magicsketch.io/mirror/) Plugin.

A Sketch file useful when you need to mock one of these iOS pickers. This gizmo is a particular pain to recreate so I made a template for it. Why not add it to your Sketch templates folder.

1. Edit your picker options.
2. Unselect everything and refresh MagicMirror.
3. Grab your picker mockup.
